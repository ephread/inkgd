Welcome to the official documentation of *inkgd*, an implementation of Ink's
runtime for Godot, in pure GDScript.

The table of contents below, as well as the sidebar, should let you easily find
the topic you're looking for. If it's your first time using *inkgd*, we
recommend you start with :doc:`getting_started/introduction` first.

If you prefer a more hands-on approach, feel free to tinker with the
`example project`_ (*inkgd*'s repository is the example project itself).

.. _`example project`: https://github.com/ephread/inkgd/

.. The version is hardcoded for now. The inability to nest markup in reST is
.. really annoying. Hopefully MyST can solve some of those issues.

While looking for an implementation of **ink** in Godot, you may have come across
godot-ink_. *inkgd* and *godot-ink* have different philosophies and purposes. If
you are not certain which one you should use,
:doc:`advanced/choosing_between_inkgd_and_godot_ink` offers a breakdown of their
differences.
